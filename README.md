# AI-Restricted Open Standard (AIROS)

**An open framework by [VisionZeroAI (Pty) Ltd](https://www.visionzero.co.za)**  
Protecting private and confidential data from unauthorized AI ingestion.

---

## 🌐 Overview

The **AI-Restricted Open Standard (AIROS)** defines a universal tagging and verification framework that allows organizations to **mark documents as “AI-Restricted.”**

This standard prevents sensitive or private files — such as internal reports, client data, or IP-sensitive material — from being uploaded or ingested into **AI systems, LLMs, or data aggregation pipelines.**

AIROS enables cross-platform interoperability so that AI vendors, enterprises, and cloud providers can **recognize and respect AI-restriction flags** embedded at the document level.

## 🎯 Vision & Mission

At VisionZeroAI, we believe privacy and innovation can coexist.

AIROS was developed to:
- Prevent unauthorized AI ingestion of sensitive data.  
- Empower organizations to control where their documents can go.  
- Encourage responsible AI use through **verifiable technical standards.**  
- Create a trusted ecosystem where humans and AI systems respect digital boundaries.

---

## ⚙️ Technical Overview

AIROS uses:
- **Metadata Tagging (XMP / Custom Properties)** — embedding verifiable AI-restriction identifiers into file headers (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.).  
- **Verification SDKs** — allowing AI platforms to auto-check tags before accepting uploads or model training.  
- **Trust Registry (Planned)** — public directory of registered organizations and key validation records.

### 🔗 Future Integrations
- Cloud Security Gateways (e.g., Microsoft 365 DLP, Google Workspace, AWS Macie)  
- AI Platform SDKs for pre-ingestion filtering  
- Document lifecycle auditing and proof of compliance

---

## 🧩 Use Cases

- **Enterprises** — Protect trade secrets and client data from being uploaded to public AI tools.  
- **Governments** — Automate privacy and data residency enforcement.  
- **AI Companies** — Adopt AIROS to demonstrate ethical and compliant AI data handling.  
- **Developers** — Integrate tag validation via SDK or REST API.
