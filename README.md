# AI-Restricted Open Standard (AIROS)

**An open framework by [VisionZeroAI (Pty) Ltd](https://www.visionzero.co.za)**  
Protecting private and confidential data from unauthorized AI ingestion.

---

## üåê Overview

The **AI-Restricted Open Standard (AIROS)** defines a universal tagging and verification framework that allows organizations to **mark digital documents as ‚ÄúAI-Restricted.‚Äù**

This standard ensures that sensitive or private files ‚Äî such as internal reports, client data, or IP-sensitive materials ‚Äî cannot be uploaded or ingested into **AI systems, LLMs, or automated data pipelines** without consent.

AIROS enables cross-platform interoperability so that AI vendors, enterprises, and cloud providers can **detect and respect AI-restriction flags** embedded within document metadata or sidecar files.

## üéØ Vision & Mission

At VisionZeroAI, we believe **privacy and innovation can coexist**.

AIROS was developed to:
- Prevent unauthorized AI ingestion of sensitive data.  
- Empower organizations to control how and where their documents are used.  
- Encourage responsible AI adoption through **verifiable, transparent standards**.  
- Build a trusted global ecosystem where AI systems respect digital boundaries.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Overview

AIROS introduces a verifiable, vendor-neutral tagging system for digital assets.

**Core Components**
- **Metadata Tagging (XMP / Custom Properties)** ‚Äî embeds cryptographically verifiable AI-restriction identifiers within supported file formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.).  
- **Verification SDKs (Python, Node, REST)** ‚Äî allow AI platforms to auto-check for AIROS tags before accepting or processing uploads.  
- **Trust Registry (Planned)** ‚Äî a global directory for key verification, revocation, and organization identity validation.

**Future Integrations**
- Cloud DLP and compliance systems (e.g., Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, AWS Macie).  
- AI platform ingestion filters (OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, etc.).  
- Document lifecycle monitoring and compliance analytics.
