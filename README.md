# 🧠 AI-Restricted Open Standard (AIROS)

**An open framework by [VisionZero](https://www.visionzero.co.za)**  
Protecting private and confidential data from unauthorized AI ingestion.

---

## 🌍 Overview

The **AI-Restricted Open Standard (AIROS)** defines a universal tagging and verification framework that allows organizations to **mark documents as “AI-Restricted.”**  

This standard is designed to prevent sensitive or private files (e.g., internal reports, client data, IP-sensitive material) from being uploaded or ingested into **AI systems**, **LLMs**, or **data aggregation pipelines**.

AIROS enables interoperability across platforms, allowing AI vendors, enterprises, and cloud providers to **recognize and respect AI restriction flags** embedded at the document level.

## 🏗️ Vision & Mission

At **VisionZero**, we believe privacy and innovation can coexist.

AIROS was developed to:
- Prevent unauthorized AI ingestion of sensitive data.  
- Empower organizations to control where their documents can go.  
- Encourage responsible AI use through **voluntary technical enforcement standards**.  
- Create a trusted ecosystem where humans and AI systems respect digital boundaries.

---

## ⚙️ Technical Overview

AIROS uses:
- **Metadata Tagging** — embedding verifiable AI-restriction identifiers into document headers (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.).  
- **Verification SDKs** — allowing AI platforms to auto-check tags before accepting or processing uploads.  
- **Public Registry (Planned)** — an open directory of tag validation keys and registered organizations.

Future integrations include:
- Cloud Security Gateways (e.g., Microsoft 365 DLP, Google Workspace, AWS Macie)
- AI platform SDKs for ingestion filtering
- Document lifecycle auditing and proof of compliance

---

## 🧩 Use Cases

- **Enterprises:** Protect trade secrets and client data from being uploaded to public AI tools.  
- **Governments:** Enforce data residency and privacy controls automatically.  
- **AI Companies:** Adopt AIROS compliance to prove responsible AI data handling.  
- **Developers:** Integrate tag validation into apps via SDK or REST API.
